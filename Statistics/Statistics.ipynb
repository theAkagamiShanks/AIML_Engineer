    "**Example:**  \n",
    "Suppose your exam scores are: **50, 60, 70, 80, 90**  \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Mean (Average)**  \n",
    "📌 **Pros:**  \n",
    "✅ Uses all values → Gives a complete picture of the data.  \n",
    "✅ Best for normally distributed (balanced) data.  \n",
    "✅ Useful in calculations like variance and standard deviation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Cons:**  \n",
    "❌ **Sensitive to outliers** (extreme values can distort it).  \n",
    "   - Example: **10, 20, 30, 40, 1000** → Mean = **220**, which doesn’t represent most numbers.  \n",
    "❌ Doesn’t always show the most common value.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Best used when:** Data is evenly spread, and there are no extreme outliers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Median (Middle Value)**  \n",
    "📌 **Pros:**  \n",
    "✅ **Not affected by outliers** (good for skewed data).  \n",
    "✅ Always gives a real data value (not like mean, which can be a decimal).  \n",
    "✅ Great for analyzing income, house prices, etc. (where extremes exist).  \n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Cons:**  \n",
    "❌ Ignores most values except the middle ones.  \n",
    "❌ Less useful for further calculations (like standard deviation).  \n",
    "❌ If the dataset is large, finding the median manually takes time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Best used when:** There are extreme values or skewed distributions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Mode (Most Frequent Value)**  \n",
    "📌 **Pros:**  \n",
    "✅ Works well for **categorical data** (e.g., most popular movie genre).  \n",
    "✅ Simple to find, no calculations needed.  \n",
    "✅ Useful for detecting trends (e.g., most common customer complaint).  \n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Cons:**  \n",
    "❌ Sometimes there is **no mode** or **more than one mode**, making it unclear.  \n",
    "❌ Doesn’t consider all numbers.  \n",
    "❌ Less useful for numerical analysis compared to mean and median.  \n",
