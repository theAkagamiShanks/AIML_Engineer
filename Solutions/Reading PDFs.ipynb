    "## 📚 Libraries for Reading PDFs in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **General PDF Text Extraction**\n",
    "- **PyPDF2** → Basic text extraction, splitting/merging PDFs.  \n",
    "- **pdfplumber** → More advanced; extracts text with layout info, tables, and metadata.  \n",
    "- **pdfminer.six** → Low-level control for extracting text and layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Tables Extraction**\n",
    "- **camelot-py** → Extracts tables from PDFs into Pandas DataFrames. Works best with vector-based PDFs.  \n",
    "- **tabula-py** → Wrapper around Java’s Tabula; extracts tables into DataFrames.  \n",
    "- **pdfplumber** → Can also detect and extract tables, though less powerful than Camelot/Tabula.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Charts, Figures, and Images**\n",
    "- **PyMuPDF (fitz)** → Can extract images, vector graphics, and metadata.  \n",
    "- **pdf2image** → Converts PDF pages into images for further processing (e.g., OCR or chart recognition).  \n",
    "- **OpenCV + Tesseract OCR** → For analyzing charts/diagrams once converted to images.  \n",
    "- **LayoutParser** → Useful for detecting visual elements (charts, figures, captions) in page images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Structured Layout Understanding (for RAG)**\n",
    "- **Unstructured** (by Unstructured.io) → Splits PDFs into semantic chunks (paragraphs, tables, images).  \n",
    "- **LangChain integrations** → Has loaders for PDFs (`PyPDFLoader`, `UnstructuredPDFLoader`) that combine text + tables for RAG pipelines.  \n",
    "- **LLMs with vision** (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4V) → Can interpret charts directly if you feed them extracted images.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Typical Workflow for RAG with PDFs\n",
    "1. **Extract text + tables**  \n",
    "   - Use `pdfplumber` or `camelot` to get structured text and DataFrames.  \n",
    "2. **Extract charts/images**  \n",
    "   - Use `PyMuPDF` or `pdf2image` → then OCR or vision models.  \n",
    "3. **Chunk the content**  \n",
    "   - Split into semantic units (paragraphs, tables, captions).  \n",
    "4. **Embed and store**  \n",
    "   - Convert chunks into embeddings (e.g., with `sentence-transformers`, `OpenAI embeddings`, or `Gemini embeddings`).  \n",
    "5. **Retrieve + augment**  \n",
    "   - Use a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS) for retrieval in your RAG pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Key Notes\n",
    "- **Tables → Camelot/Tabula** are your best bet.  \n",
    "- **Charts → PyMuPDF + OCR/vision models**.  \n",
    "- **Text → pdfplumber/Unstructured** for clean extraction.  \n",
    "- Combine them in preprocessing before embedding for RAG.\n",

    "| **pdfminer.six** | Low-level text + layout extraction | Powerful but verbose API; slow on large PDFs; no direct table/chart support. |\n",
    "| **pdfplumber** | Text + tables extraction | Works well for simple tables; struggles with complex multi-line cells or charts. |\n",
    "| **camelot-py** | Table extraction into Pandas DataFrames | Only works on vector-based PDFs (not scanned images); fails on messy layouts. |\n",

    "| **pdf2image**  | Converts PDF pages to images | No text extraction; must combine with OCR (e.g., Tesseract). |\n",
    "| **Tesseract OCR** | Text recognition from scanned PDFs/images | Accuracy depends on image quality; doesn’t handle tables/charts natively. |\n",

    "| **Google Document AI** | OCR + layout + table extraction | Paid API; requires GCP setup; charts often need extra vision models. |\n",
    "| **Azure Form Recognizer** | OCR + tables + key-value pairs | Paid API; best for forms; charts/images need custom handling. |\n",
    "| **Docsumo / Nanonets / Kofax** | Commercial document parsing | Subscription-based; optimized for invoices/forms, not general PDFs. |\n",

    "## ⚡ Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **Free tools** (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, Camelot, PyMuPDF) → great for text and simple tables, but weak on charts/complex layouts.  \n",
    "- **Paid cloud APIs** (AWS Textract, Google Document AI, Azure Form Recognizer) → handle OCR, tables, and structured data better, but cost scales with usage.  \n",
    "- **Charts/figures** → almost always require **image extraction + OCR/vision models** (free with Tesseract/OpenCV, or paid with multimodal LLMs like Gemini/GPT-4V).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Since you’re building for **RAG**, the usual stack is:  \n",
    "- **Free**: `pdfplumber` + `camelot` for text/tables, `PyMuPDF` + `Tesseract` for charts.  \n",
    "- **Paid (optional)**: Cloud OCR (Textract/Document AI) if you need higher accuracy or enterprise scale.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to sketch a **comparison pipeline** showing how a free-only setup vs. a paid setup would look for RAG? That way you’ll see exactly where each tool fits.\n"
