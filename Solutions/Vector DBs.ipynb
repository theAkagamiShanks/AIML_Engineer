    "| **FAISS (Meta)** | Library | Fast, mature, supports CPU/GPU, great for prototyping | No built-in persistence (you must handle saving/loading); limited distributed scaling; not a full DB, more a library. |\n",
    "| **Annoy (Spotify)** | Library | Lightweight, great for approximate nearest neighbor search | Read-only once built; slower updates; not ideal for dynamic datasets. |\n",
    "| **Weaviate (OSS edition)** | Full DB | Rich features: hybrid search, schema, modules for text/image/audio | Free tier limited; heavier setup; advanced modules may require paid cloud. |\n",
    "| **Milvus** | Full DB | Scalable, distributed, supports billions of vectors | Requires cluster setup for scale; more ops overhead than FAISS. |\n",
    "| **Qdrant** | Full DB | Rust-based, fast, user-friendly API, integrates well with LangChain | Free self-hosting; cloud has paid tiers; fewer enterprise integrations than Pinecone. |\n",
    "| **Chroma** | Lightweight DB | Simple, Python-native, great for small RAG projects | Not optimized for huge datasets; limited scaling/distributed features. |\n",

    "| **Qdrant Cloud** | Managed DB | Hosted version with scaling and monitoring | Paid tiers; free tier limited in size. |\n",
    "| **Milvus Cloud (Zilliz)** | Managed DB | Enterprise-grade scaling, monitoring, support | Paid; more complex pricing. |\n",
    "| **Redis Enterprise (with vector search)** | General DB + vector search | Combines caching + vector search; enterprise-ready | Paid license; heavier infra if only vectors are needed. |\n",
    "| **ElasticSearch + vector search (Elastic Cloud)** | General search engine with vector support | Combines keyword + vector search | Paid for cloud; heavier setup compared to pure vector DBs. |\n",

    "## ⚡ Key Takeaways\n",
    "- **Free / OSS** → FAISS, Annoy, Chroma are great for small projects or prototyping. Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant scale better but need infra setup.  \n",
    "- **Paid / Cloud** → Pinecone, Qdrant Cloud, Weaviate Cloud are easiest to use, fully managed, but cost grows with dataset size.  \n",
    "- **Hybrid search** (text + vector) → Weaviate, ElasticSearch, Qdrant support this natively.  \n",
    "- **Charts & tables in PDFs** → Once extracted, embeddings go into these DBs for retrieval in RAG.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 For your **RAG pipeline**, a common free stack is:  \n",
    "- **Chroma or Qdrant (self-hosted)** for embeddings storage.  \n",
    "- **FAISS** if you just need fast local similarity search.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A common paid stack is:  \n",
    "- **Pinecone** for managed scaling + monitoring.  \n",
    "- **Weaviate Cloud** if you want hybrid search with enterprise support.  \n",
